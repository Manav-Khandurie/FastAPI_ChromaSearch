# FastAPI_ChromaSearch
As a take-home task, we propose implementing a lightweight FastAPl server for RAG. This server should utilize ChromaDB's persistent client for ingesting and querying documents (PDE DOC, DOCX, TXT). Leverage sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (CPU) from Hugging Face for embeddings.
